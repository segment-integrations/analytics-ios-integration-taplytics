## Usage

After adding the dependency, you must register the integration with our SDK.  To do this, import the Taplytics integration in your `AppDelegate`:

```
#import <Segment-Taplytics/SEGTaplyticsIntegrationFactory.h>
```

And add the following lines:

```
NSString *const SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY = @" ... ";
SEGAnalyticsConfiguration *config = [SEGAnalyticsConfiguration configurationWithWriteKey:SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY];

[config use:[SEGTaplyticsIntegrationFactory instance]];

[SEGAnalytics setupWithConfiguration:config];

```

### Initialize Taplytics without Segment

If you would like to initialize Taplytics yourself to leverage functionality required on initialization, you can use Taplytics native methods to initialize then use `skipInitialization` to skip initializing through Segment.

```
NSString *const SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY = @" ... ";
SEGAnalyticsConfiguration *config = [SEGAnalyticsConfiguration configurationWithWriteKey:SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY];

// Add Taplytics methods to initialize and any functionality required prior to initialization here.
[Taplytics startTaplyticsAPIKey:<apiKey>....];

[config use:[SEGTaplyticsIntegrationFactory skipInitialization]];

[SEGAnalytics setupWithConfiguration:config];
```
